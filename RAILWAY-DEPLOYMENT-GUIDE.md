# üöÇ **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - LOGISTICS PLATFORM**

## üìã **Railway Deployment Overview**

Railway, modern microservices i√ßin ideal bir cloud platform. Logistics Platform'umuzu Railway'e deploy etmek i√ßin her servisi ayrƒ± ayrƒ± deploy edeceƒüiz.

---

## üöÄ **STEP 1: Railway Account Setup**

### 1.1 Railway Hesabƒ± Olu≈üturma
1. https://railway.app adresine gidin
2. GitHub hesabƒ±nƒ±zla giri≈ü yapƒ±n
3. "New Project" butonuna tƒ±klayƒ±n

### 1.2 GitHub Repository Baƒülama
```bash
# Projeyi GitHub'a push edin (eƒüer hen√ºz yapmadƒ±ysanƒ±z)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Logistics Platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/logistics-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **STEP 2: Database Configuration (Supabase Integration)**

### 2.1 Environment Variables Hazƒ±rlama
Railway'de her servis i√ßin environment variables tanƒ±mlayacaƒüƒ±z:

```bash
# Supabase Connection Details
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://[PROJECT-ID].supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR-ANON-KEY]

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=[STRONG-SECRET-KEY]
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000

# Service Discovery (Railway internal URLs)
EUREKA_DEFAULT_ZONE=https://discovery-service.railway.app/eureka/
CONFIG_SERVER_URL=https://config-service.railway.app
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **STEP 3: Service Deployment Order**

Railway'de servisleri doƒüru sƒ±rayla deploy etmeliyiz:

    url: ${DATABASE_URL}
    username: postgres
    password: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
    show-sql: false

server:
  port: ${PORT:8080}

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: ${EUREKA_DEFAULT_ZONE:http://localhost:8761/eureka/}
  instance:
    hostname: ${RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN:localhost}
    prefer-ip-address: false

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics
```

## üöÄ **STEP 6: Deployment Process**

### 6.1 Manuel Deployment
```bash
# 1. Config Server Deploy
railway login
railway link [config-server-project-id]
railway up

# 2. Discovery Server Deploy (Config Server hazƒ±r olduktan sonra)
railway link [discovery-server-project-id]

```

### 6.2 Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Railway

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean package -DskipTests
      
      - name: Deploy Config Server

          token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Deploy User Service
        uses: railway-deploy@v1
        with:
          service: user-service
          token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Deploy Transport Service
        uses: railway-deploy@v1
        with:
          service: transport-service
          token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
```

---

## üîó **STEP 7: Service URLs and Testing**

### 7.1 Railway Service URLs
Railway deployment sonrasƒ± ≈üu URL'leri alacaksƒ±nƒ±z:

```bash
# Service URLs
CONFIG_SERVER: https://config-service-production.railway.app
DISCOVERY_SERVER: https://discovery-service-production.railway.app
GATEWAY_SERVICE: https://gateway-service-production.railway.app
AUTH_SERVICE: https://auth-service-production.railway.app
USER_SERVICE: https://user-service-production.railway.app
TRANSPORT_SERVICE: https://transport-service-production.railway.app
```

### 7.2 Production Testing
```bash
# Health Check
curl https://gateway-service-production.railway.app/actuator/health

# Public Tracking Test
curl https://gateway-service-production.railway.app/api/transport/shipments/tracking/TRK17056789123456

# Admin Login Test
curl -X POST https://gateway-service-production.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'
```

---

## üìä **STEP 8: Monitoring and Scaling**

### 8.1 Railway Monitoring
```bash
# Railway CLI ile monitoring
railway logs --service=gateway-service
railway status
railway metrics
```

### 8.2 Auto-Scaling Configuration
```toml
# railway.toml scaling configuration
[deploy]
replicas = 2
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[resources]
memory = "1Gi"
cpu = "0.5"
```

---

## üîí **STEP 9: Security and Environment Variables**

### 9.1 Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Railway Dashboard'da her servis i√ßin set edin:

# Common Variables
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway
JWT_SECRET=[STRONG-SECRET-256-BIT]
DATABASE_URL=[SUPABASE-CONNECTION-STRING]

# Service-Specific Variables
EUREKA_DEFAULT_ZONE=https://discovery-service-production.railway.app/eureka/
CONFIG_SERVER_URL=https://config-service-production.railway.app

# Security Variables
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

### 9.2 SSL/TLS Configuration
Railway otomatik olarak SSL sertifikasƒ± saƒülar. Ek konfig√ºrasyon gerekmez.

---

## üö® **STEP 10: Troubleshooting**

### 10.1 Common Issues
```bash
# Service Discovery Issues
railway logs --service=discovery-server

# Database Connection Issues
railway logs --service=auth-service | grep -i database

# Memory Issues
railway metrics --service=transport-service
```

### 10.2 Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service health
curl https://[service-url]/actuator/health

# Check service registration
curl https://discovery-service-production.railway.app/eureka/apps

# Check environment variables
railway variables --service=gateway-service
```

---

## üí∞ **STEP 11: Cost Optimization**

### 11.1 Railway Pricing
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month per service
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month per service
- **Team Plan**: Custom pricing

### 11.2 Cost Optimization Tips
```toml
# Optimize resource usage
[resources]
memory = "512Mi"  # Minimum required
cpu = "0.25"      # Minimum required

# Use fewer replicas for non-critical services
[deploy]
replicas = 1
```
