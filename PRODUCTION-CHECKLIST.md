- [ ] Database passwords changed from defaults
- [ ] CORS origins configured for your domain
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers enabled

### Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection tested

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Steps**

### Step 1: Environment Preparation
```bash
# Run the setup script
chmod +x deploy-production.sh
./deploy-production.sh
```

### Step 2: Configuration Review
```bash
# Review and customize environment
nano .env.production

# Key settings to verify:
# - DATABASE_PASSWORD (strong password)
# - JWT_SECRET (secure random string)
# - CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS (your domain)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Services
```bash
# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh

# Monitor deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```

### Step 4: Health Verification
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./health-check-production.sh

# Test key endpoints
curl http://localhost/actuator/health
curl http://localhost/api/auth/health
```

### Step 5: Functional Testing
```bash
# Run automated tests against production
npm test

# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","email":"admin@company.com","password":"admin123"}'

# Test public tracking
curl http://localhost/api/transport/shipments/tracking/TEST123
```

## ðŸ”§ **Production Maintenance**

### Daily Tasks
- [ ] Check service health
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Verify backup completion

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Performance analysis
- [ ] Security log review
- [ ] Database maintenance
- [ ] Update dependency check

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Security updates
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Capacity planning
- [ ] Disaster recovery test

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs service-name

# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Restart specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart service-name
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database connectivity
docker exec -it logistics-postgres-prod psql -U logistics_user -d logistics_db

# Check database logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs postgres
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor real-time metrics
curl http://localhost/actuator/metrics

# Check JVM memory
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used

# Database performance
docker exec logistics-postgres-prod pg_stat_activity
```

## ðŸ“ž **Support Contacts**

### Emergency Contacts
- **System Administrator**: [Your Contact]
- **Database Administrator**: [Your Contact]
- **Security Team**: [Your Contact]

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1**: Service restart
2. **Level 2**: System administrator
3. **Level 3**: Full system recovery

---

## ðŸ“ˆ **Scaling Guidelines**

### Horizontal Scaling
```bash
# Scale specific services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --scale auth-service=3
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --scale transport-service=5
```

### Vertical Scaling
```yaml
# Update resource limits in docker-compose.production.yml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 2G
      cpus: '1.0'
```
