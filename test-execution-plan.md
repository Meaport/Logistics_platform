## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **Service Won't Start**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify port availability
   - Check application.yml configuration

2. **401 Unauthorized Errors**
   - Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
   - Check Authorization header format
   - Ensure user has proper roles

3. **503 Service Unavailable**
   - Check if target service is registered with Eureka
   - Verify service discovery is working
   - Check network connectivity

4. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials
   - Ensure databases exist

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check service logs
tail -f auth-service/logs/application.log

tail -f transport-service/logs/application.log

# Check network connectivity
curl -v http://localhost:8761/eureka/apps
curl -v http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Verify JWT token
echo "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9..." | base64 -d
